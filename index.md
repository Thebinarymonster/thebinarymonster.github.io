# Welcome to my blog!

the world is stuck   
I want covid to be done  
but when will it be?  

## This is a poetry blog.
What that means is that most Mondays there will be at least one new poem on this blog, so check back weekly. All the poems are/will be written by me.

## However...
### UPDATE 5-1-20
Sorry I haven't been posting in a while. I'll try to get back to posting regularly, but you might other stuff here.

## More to learn

There is always  
more to learn.  
Whether you are an adult, kid, or baby, there's  
more to learn

More to learn about math.  
More to learn about reading.  
More to learn about science, writing, and more!  

You can't know it all,  
She can't know it all,  
He can't know it all,  
They can't know it all,  

Even when we work together,  
More to learn!

## Practically Triangular 

I am: not quite, so close, only 2 sides but I want 3  
Come on, I don't even have one knee   
Almost, unlike everyone else   

I am different   
I am special   
And I don't need that third side

## Here is my first poem:


evergreens are forever green  
unanimosly green  
oh what liberty to be green  
the payment-stares of wonder  

as if you were at a baseball game  
your favorite player-a home run  
there might be stares of awe or fame  
I know it must be hot in that sun  


### And don't forget to check back next Monday for more! :)
