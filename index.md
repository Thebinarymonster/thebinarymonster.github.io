## Practically Triangular 

I am: not quite, so close, only 2 sides but I want 3  
Come on, I don't even have one knee   
Almost, unlike everyone else   

I am different   
I am special   
And I don't need that third side

## Here is my first poem:


evergreens are forever green  
unanimosly green  
oh what liberty to be green  
the payment-stares of wonder  

as if you were at a baseball game  
your favorite player-a home run  
there might be stares of awe or fame  
I know it must be hot in that sun  


### And don't forget to check back next Monday for more! :)
