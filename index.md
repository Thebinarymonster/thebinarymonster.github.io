# Welcome to my blog!

## This is a poetry blog.
What that means is that every Monday there will be at least one new poem on this blog, so check back weekly. All the poems are/will be written by me.


## Here is my first poem:


evergreens are forever green

unanimosly green

oh what liberty to be green

the payment-stares of wonder

as if you were at a baseball game

your favorite player-a home run

there might be stares of awe or fame

I know it must be hot in that sun


### And don't forget to check back next Monday for more! :)
